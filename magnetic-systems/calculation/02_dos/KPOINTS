K-Points for DOS Calculation
0                    # 0 = auto-generate k-points
Monkhorst-Pack       # Monkhorst-Pack grid
  12 12  1           # k-point mesh: 12×12×1 (denser than SCF)
0.0  0.0  0.0        # No shift

# Dense K-point Mesh for DOS:
# - 12×12×1: Denser than SCF (8×8×1) for accurate DOS
# - Required for ISMEAR=-5 (tetrahedron method)
# - Ensures smooth DOS curves without artifacts
#
# Why denser mesh?
#   - Tetrahedron method needs many k-points
#   - Captures fine details near Fermi level
#   - Better band gap estimation
#
# Alternatives:
#   - 14×14×1 or 16×16×1 for publication-quality DOS
#   - Test convergence by comparing DOSCAR
