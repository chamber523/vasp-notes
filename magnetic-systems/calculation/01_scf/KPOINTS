K-Points for SCF Calculation
0                    # 0 = auto-generate k-points
Monkhorst-Pack       # Monkhorst-Pack grid (uniform sampling)
  8  8  1            # k-point mesh: 8×8×1
0.0  0.0  0.0        # Shift: No shift (Gamma-centered for even grids)

# K-point Mesh Explanation:
# - 8×8×1 grid: Dense in ab-plane, sparse along c-axis
# - Rationale: Layered material with weak interlayer coupling
# - c-axis: Only 1 k-point because supercell is large (36.24 Å)
# - ab-plane: 8×8 ensures good convergence for 5.07 Å cell

# K-point Convergence Test Results (if available):
# k-mesh    E_total (eV)    ΔE (meV)
# 4×4×1     reference       -
# 6×6×1     ref + X         X
# 8×8×1     ref + Y         Y-X  ← Converged
# 10×10×1   ref + Z         Z-Y  ← Small change

# Recommended mesh for different calculations:
# - Relaxation: 6×6×1 (faster, sufficient accuracy)
# - SCF: 8×8×1 (good balance)
# - DOS: 12×12×1 or denser with ISMEAR=-5
# - Band: High-symmetry k-path
